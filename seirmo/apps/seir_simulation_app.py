motivation = """
Scientists and researchers are trying to understand the COVID-19 outbreak in hopes to
 predict and defeat the disease. In order to understand the spread and
 infecting rate of the disease, many models are used to characterise the
 disease, such as the SEIR model and the branching processes model.  
  
SEIR model is a deterministic model and has been used to model infectious
 disease.  """

# Model description
description = """
The SEIR model is a model of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs). 
It assigns a population into 4 groups, which are Susceptible(S), Exposed(E), Infectious(I) 
and Recovered(R). In this model, individuals will transit from being Susceptible to Exposed, from 
Exposed to Infectious and from Infectious to Recovered. To control the rate at which the individuals
transit from one state to the other, some parameters are imposed in the model.  
  
The model is characterised by few constants, which include the *reproduction number*, the 
*incubation period* and the *infection period*. The *reproduction number* measures the number of 
infected cases originating from primary infections, the *incubation period* defines the average 
period of time for exposed individuals to become infectious, and the *infection period* is the 
average period of time for infected patients to recover from the disease.  
  
The system of ODEs is solved to retrieve the number of inviduals in each S, E, I and R group. The
incidence number is then inferred from the solution. To solve the system of ODEs, the initial value of
each group is required. Different initial values will give different solutions.  
  
You are welcome to explore the effect of initial sizes of the S, E, I and R groups, as well as 
the different transition periods with the paramter sliders below.
